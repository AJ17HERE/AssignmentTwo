    <p>Phulkari is a traditional embroidery art form that originated in the Punjab region of India and Pakistan. The word "phulkari" means "flower work" in Punjabi, and the art form involves creating vibrant and intricate designs using brightly colored threads on a plain or colored fabric.

        Phulkari embroidery is done by hand, and the designs often include floral and geometric patterns, with each motif having a symbolic meaning. The embroidery is done on the reverse side of the fabric, with the finished product displaying a clean, uncluttered look.
        
        The art form has its roots in Punjabi rural culture, where women would create phulkari embroidered textiles for their dowry or as gifts for special occasions like weddings. The embroidery was passed down from generation to generation, with each family adding its unique style to the art form.
        
        Today, phulkari has become popular around the world and is used on a variety of products such as sarees, shawls, dupattas, and home furnishings. The art form has also been recognized as a Geographical Indication (GI) product by the Indian government, which aims to protect and promote the traditional art form</p>
