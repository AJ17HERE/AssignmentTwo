    <p>Madhubani painting is a traditional folk art form that originated in the Mithila region of Bihar, India. It is one of the oldest forms of Indian art and is known for its vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and use of natural dyes.

        Madhubani painting is typically created using fingers, twigs, brushes, and natural dyes made from fruits, flowers, and other plant materials. The paintings often depict Hindu deities, nature, and social events such as weddings and festivals. The art form is characterized by its distinctive use of double lines and geometric patterns, which are filled with bright colors.
        
        Traditionally, Madhubani paintings were created by women of the Mithila region as a form of decoration for homes during special occasions. However, with increasing popularity, the art form has become a source of income for many artists, both male and female, and is now displayed in galleries and museums around the world.
        
        Madhubani painting has also gained recognition as a form of intellectual property and has been granted a Geographical Indication (GI) status by the Indian government to protect and promote the art form.</p>
